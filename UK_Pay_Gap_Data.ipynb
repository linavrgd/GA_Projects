    "## UK Gender Pay Gap\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "Employers with 250 or more employees in UK had to publish and report specific figures about their gender pay gap. The gender pay gap is the difference between the average earnings of men and women, expressed relative to men’s earnings. For example, ‘women earn 15% less than men per hour’.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have also included the UK industry codes (aka SIC codes) in order to allow industry-based analysis.\n",

    "  * **Current predictor variables**: - Industry, location, company size.\n",
